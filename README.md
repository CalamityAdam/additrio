## License 📜

This software is UNLICENSED. 😱 Yes, you read that correctly, dear developer.

We've worked tirelessly day and night to create this masterpiece we call **AddiTrio**. This function wasn't written over a cup of coffee during a commercial break. No sir/madam, it was a journey filled with blood, sweat, and tears (okay, maybe no blood, but you get the idea). 👷‍♀️👷‍♂️🌙

So, before you consider "borrowing" our hard work for your weekend hackathon, or that side project you promised your friend, just remember - everyone has to make a living. We might not be selling this function for cold, hard cash, but we did put a piece of our soul into it. 😌💖

**In short: Do NOT use this function without explicit permission from us, the authors. Unauthorized copying, modification, distribution, or any other unpermitted use is not allowed. Seriously. Don't be that person.** 🚫🔐

If you'd like to use this function or discuss potential licensing options, feel free to get in touch! We're generally nice people, and we don't bite. Unless, of course, you try to steal our code. 😊🔪

## Final Thoughts 🌠

We hope you find **AddiTrio** as exciting and useful as we do! It's a small step for a developer, but a giant leap for their efficiency! ✨

Happy Coding! 🖥️
